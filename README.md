orgmode in vimwiki

# why vimwiki-org?

This is a fork of vim-orgmode, we try to combine the power of vimwiki and orgmode.  
orgmode is extremly awesome, but it's not an general document format, when use it in a team,  
it's always difficult.

And vimwiki can use markdown syntax, markdown is a pre-standard doc format for programmers,  
and with vimwiki, write document in vim is pretty closed to orgmode in Emacs.

So, I decide to combine them: use orgmode for GTD, and use vimwiki for documents.  
When you switch between two file format, it's painful, so it's better to use one syntax for them.

Then I make this plugin, forked from vim-orgmode, but bring vimwiki(markdown) syntax  
to orgmode.

So, finaly we write markdown syntax with orgmode power! Wow!
